  On being burnout for the first time.

At the time of this writing I'm burned out. I had no doubt it was a thing and that
it could happen to anyone. However, I couldn't see myself suffering from this.
At least not so soon.

I've been pretty active for the past 4 to 5 years due to college, courses, work
and other activities. Yet all of this haven't bothered me in the slightest,
until now. I couldn't take control of basic chores, missed the point of
meetings after a few moments, had no will to leave the bed and many other
things. Moreover, It's a strange feeling with predefined steps:

1. You know what you have to do;
2. You know it's within your capabilities;
3. You get excited to do the task;
4. Your body just *will not do it*.

There you go, you now have the recipe to fight against yourself for a whole
day. This will be a excruciating battle until you hit the bed and repeat it the
next morning. That is, if you aren't already going to sleep late due to forcing
yourself to be productive throughout the day. Realizing I was battling my own
was really important to improve my situation. I started by cleaning my room,
then exercising, putting a alarm to tell me when to eat and so on. My next step
was to change my whole environment by looking after a new job.

Currently I'm not in position to take a sabbatical period of time to discover
new hobbies or a new career - and I don't want to, as I love my current
profession. So, what's left to ponder to change this situation, I may ask
myself? To be honest, I have no clue. While I'm in the process to land a new
job I feel that this might be the response I needed to this feeling. New
challenges, new people, new technologies and new everything.
