- =os/user=: There's a C library used to transform user and group ids to user
  and group names. It can also get names from LDAP.

- =net=: Uses a C library to resolve DNS and help on platforms that don't have a
  resolv.conf.

Both have a pure [[id:050485c8-cd04-4e3e-800f-1b8930836372][Go]] implementation to some degree.
